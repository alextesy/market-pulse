## Data Processing

### Cleaning Rules Applied

1. **Symbol Cleaning**
   - Convert to uppercase
   - Strip whitespace
   - Remove trailing suffixes (^, /, .)
   - Filter out test/placeholder symbols
   - Validate with regex: `^[A-Z]{1,5}$`

2. **Name Cleaning**
   - Strip whitespace and normalize
   - Remove common corporate suffixes (Inc, Corp, Corporation, Company, Co, LLC, Ltd, Limited)

3. **Deduplication**
   - Remove duplicate symbols
   - Merge names when identical but different cases

4. **Alias Generation**
   - Cashtag format: `$SYMBOL`
   - Lowercase symbol
   - Lowercase company name
   - Company name without spaces
   - Common synonyms (e.g., "apple" â†’ "aapl", "apple inc", "apple computer")
   - S&P 500 indicator for constituents

### Special Handling

- **Class Shares**: BRK.A and BRK.B are kept with aliases to BRK
- **Preferred Shares**: Ignored (filtered out)
- **Test Listings**: Removed (TEST, DUMMY, PLACEHOLDER, etc.)

## Output Files

- `tickers_main.csv`: Main ticker data with all fields

## Validation

The seeding script validates:
- Minimum 6,000 tickers total
- No duplicate symbols
- Regex validity for all symbols
- Aliases present for top 100 symbols
- Database insertion success

## Usage

Run the seeding script:
```bash
make seed-tickers
```

Or directly:
```bash
uv run python -m scripts.seed_tickers
```

## Database Schema

The processed data populates the `ticker` table with:
- `symbol` (TEXT PK): Cleaned ticker symbol
- `name` (TEXT): Cleaned company name
- `exchange` (TEXT): NASDAQ, NYSE, etc.
- `cik` (TEXT NULL): SEC CIK number
- `aliases` (JSONB): Generated aliases and synonyms
- `valid_from` (DATE NULL): Historical validity start
- `valid_to` (DATE NULL): Historical validity end

## Maintenance

The data should be refreshed periodically to capture:
- New listings
- Delistings
- Symbol changes
- Company name changes
- S&P 500 constituent changes

Consider running the seeding script weekly or monthly depending on your needs.
